Packaging scripts for Arch Linux
================================

[Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) scripts modified for the systems I handle (e.g. newer version, lighter flavor), and easier sharing.

Upstream compatibility fully preserved unless duly stated in the PKGBUILD desc.
